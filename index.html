        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p> My name is Molly Riggs. I am a senior at Texas Christian University. I enjoy being outdoors, traveling and spending time with family and friends. A fun fact about me is that I studied abroad the spring semester of my junior year in Florence, which inspired my love for travel.  </p>

         <p> I am 21 years old, and have lived in California for my whole life up until college. I have a twin sister who goes to school in Indiana, so we both chose new places to study for our college years. I always was interested in pursuing a degree in business, so the Neeley School of Business stood out to me during the college application process. </p>
        <p>I am passionate about spending time with my friends and family, traveling and being outdoors. I am majoring in marketing, and minoring in digital culture and data analytics here at TCU. I love to stay active and try new coffee spots! Something that keeps me motivated is my family. They work really hard and inspire me to do the same.
