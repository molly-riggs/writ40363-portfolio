<h2 id="about me"> About Me</h2>

<!-- the paragraph below includes bold formating -->

<p>My name is Molly Riggs. I am a senior at Texas Christian University. I enjoy being outdoors, traveling, and spending time with family and friends. A fun fact about me is that I studied abroad my spring semester of junior year in Florence, which inspired my love for travel.</p>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2

<p> I am 21 years old, and have lived in California for my whole life up until college. I have a twin sister who goes to school In Indiana, so we both chose new places to study for our college years. I always was interested in pursuing a degree in business, so the Neeley School of Business stood out to me during the college application process.</p>
