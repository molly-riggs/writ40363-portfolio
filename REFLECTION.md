<h1>Confidence Check</h1>

<h1>Learning Curve</h1>

<p> Learning GitHub has been a little bit confusing but definitely something I will get used to. Version control surprised me how smoothly it worked, I thought it might be more difficult to navigate. However, trying to really understand working in different workspaces was more difficult for me than I expected. </p>

<h1>Problem-Solving Growth</h1>

<p> I was a little bit confused when it came to using Git in the beginning. I approached solving these problems by asking people around me if the knew what to do and learning from my peers. This has improved since week 1 sinc eI know more classmates now </p>

<h1>Week 2 Reflection</h1>

<p> I think my biggest aha moment from this week was learning how to commit the files in GitHub. It felt like a major moment of progress for me. </p>

<h1>Looking Forward</h1>

<p> I am most curious about continuing to learn how to use HTML and how to continue developing code. I am most nervous about staying on top of all of the new concepts I am learning. </p>

<h1>Support and Resources</h1>

<p> I think the most helpful part of class so far has been the in class lectures. Watching you do the activity and help us through it has ben the best way to learn. </p>
